# Manchester Codes Debugging Adventure

Debugging practice for `node.js`.

## getting started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git https://github.com/CommandShiftHQ/debug-adventure.git
```

Open the repository:

```bash
  cd debug-adventure/
```


Switch to the bugged branch:

```bash
  git checkout bugs
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Run tests:

```bash
  npm test
```

## Challenge

You will see that most of the tests fail. Your challenge is to find the bugs in the code and correct them so the tests will pass. There are no bugs in the tests.

Remember:

- Always read the error messages!
- Google any error messages you don't understand.

# Good Luck!
