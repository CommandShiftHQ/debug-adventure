Debugging practice for `node.js`.

## getting started

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/debug-adventure.git
```

Open the repository:

```bash
  cd debug-adventure/
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

Switch to the bugged branch:

```bash
  git checkout bugs
```

Run tests:

```bash
  npm test
```

## Challenge

You will see that most of the tests fail. Your challenge is to find the bugs in the code and correct them so the tests will pass. There are no bugs in the tests.

🔥Hot Tip 1: Start by fixing the errors in the Weapon class 🔥  
🔥Hot Tip 2: Next fix the errors in the Character class 🔥

Remember: 
  - Always read the error messages!
  - Google any error messages you don't understand.

# Good Luck!
